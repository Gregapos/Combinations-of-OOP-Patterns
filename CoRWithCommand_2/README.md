# Iterator with Composite (Requests as Commands)

This project demonstrates the combination of the **Chain of Responsibility** and **Command** design patterns using **C#**, where requests are treated as commands that move through a chain of handlers. This approach is ideal for executing the same function in a sequence of different processing contexts.

## Design Patterns Overview

- **Chain of Responsibility**: The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows requests to pass through a chain of handlers, where each handler decides either to process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.

- **Command**: The Command pattern turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request.

## Key Elements of the Combination

- **`BaseDepartmentHandler`** Abstract Class: Defines the default behavior of all the chain handlers.
- **`HRDepartment, FinanceDepartment & LegalDepartment`** Classes: Handler types.
- **`DocumentSigningCommand`** Class: Command type.
- **`DocumentService`** Class: Performs the actual operations on the documents.

## Benefits of the Combination

By combining the **Chain of Responsibility** and **Command** patterns, the following advantages are gained:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Processing logic is encapsulated in Command objects, detached from the chain of handlers. This makes the system easier to maintain, as each component focuses on its specific role.

- **Extensibility**: Introducing new handlers (processing environments) is straightforward. Handlers can be added or removed from the chain without significantly impacting the overall system, and the system can adapt to new types of requests with minimal changes.

- **Dynamic Processing Pipelines**: The sequence of handlers can be dynamically altered at runtime, making it easy to adjust the processing flow or introduce new stages without needing to modify the entire structure.

- **Localized Changes**: When new types of commands or handlers are introduced, the impact is localized to the relevant parts of the system. This minimizes the need for extensive code changes, ensuring high maintainability.

## Considerations

While this combination offers flexibility and maintainability, some trade-offs should be noted:

- **Performance Overhead**: Passing commands through multiple handlers can introduce a performance overhead, especially if the chain is long or contains complex operations. Each handler may add some processing delay, particularly when commands require multiple processing stages.

- **Chain Complexity**: As more handlers are added to the chain, managing and keeping track of the order of operations can become more challenging. Proper design practices should be employed to mitigate this complexity

## When to Use

This combination is well-suited for scenarios where:

- Commands (requests) need to pass through multiple processing contexts or stages.

- New types of processing stages or environments are introduced frequently.

- Flexibility in dynamically adding, removing, or reordering processing stages is required.

- A clear separation between the request logic (commands) and the processing logic (handlers) is desired.

Examples of use cases include event-driven systems, logging pipelines, and middleware-based architectures.

## How to Run

1. **Ensure .NET 8 SDK is installed**: Make sure you have .NET 8 SDK installed. You can check your installed version by running:

   ```bash
   dotnet --version
   ```

2. **Build the project**: Navigate to the project folder and build the solution using:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

3. **Run the project**: After building the solution, run the project with:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
