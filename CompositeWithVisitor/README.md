# Composite with Visitor

This project demonstrates the combination of the **Composite** and **Visitor** design patterns using **C#**. By combining these patterns, we can effectively operate on hierarchical object structures without modifying their components, promoting flexibility and adaptability.

## Design Patterns Overview

- **Composite**: The Composite pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It enables clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

- **Visitor**: The Visitor pattern allows you to add further operations to objects without having to modify them. Instead, the operations are implemented as separate objects (visitors), which execute specific behavior based on the object type they visit.

## Key Elements of the Combination

- **`Employee`** Abstract Class: Represents all the node types.

- **`Developer, Designer & Manager`** Classes: Node types that represent different employee roles.

- **`Department`** Class: Composite object.

- **`IEmployeeVisitor`** Interface: Declare a method for visiting each type of element in the Composite structure. Concrete visitors implement these methods to perform specific operations on each node.

## Benefits of the Combination

By combining the **Composite** and **Visitor** patterns, the following advantages are observed:

- **Separation of Concerns**: There is a clean separation between the structure (the Composite) and the operations performed on it (the Visitors). This makes it easy to maintain the data structure while introducing new operations.

- **Extensibility**: Adding new types of nodes only requires modifications to the Visitor, without affecting the Composite structure itself. Additionally, introducing new types of visitors is straightforward, allowing for flexibility in the operations performed on the Composite.

## Considerations

Despite the benefits, there are some trade-offs:

- **Encapsulation Violation**: The Visitor pattern may expose part of the internal state of the elements it operates on, which can lead to a violation of encapsulation principles. Care must be taken to balance flexibility with object privacy.

- **Scalability**: While adding new operations (visitors) is easy, maintaining a large number of visitors can become burdensome. In scenarios with frequent introduction of new node types, the system might suffer from scaling issues as each new node requires updating all existing visitors.

## When to Use

This combination is particularly useful in scenarios where operations on a composite structure change frequently, but the structure itself remains relatively stable. Itâ€™s ideal for systems where the data structure represents a hierarchy and needs various operations applied across its elements over time.

## How to Run

1. **Ensure .NET 8 SDK is installed**: Make sure you have .NET 8 SDK installed. You can check your installed version by running:

   ```bash
   dotnet --version
   ```

2. **Build the project**: Navigate to the project folder and build the solution using:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

3. **Run the project**: After building the solution, run the project with:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
