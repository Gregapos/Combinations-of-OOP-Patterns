# Exploring Valuable Combinations and Applications of Object-Oriented Patterns

**Date of defense: April 10, 2024**

This repository contains the code for my diploma thesis entitled **"Exploring Valuable Combinations and Applications of Object-Oriented Patterns"**. The project demonstrates various combinations of popular object-oriented design patterns and how they can be used effectively together to address complex design challenges and improve the modularity, scalability, and maintainability of systems.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into multiple subprojects, each exploring a different combination of design patterns. Each subproject includes code implementations and a class diagram.

```bash

├───BuilderWithAbstractFactory
├───BuilderWithComposite
├───ChainOfResponsibilityWithComposite
├───CommandWithMemento
├───Command_Composite_State_Strategy_Singleton
├───CompositeWithVisitor
├───CoRWithCommand_1
├───CoRWithCommand_2
├───IteratorWithComposite
└───IteratorWithFactory
```

## Design Patterns Covered

The following object-oriented design patterns are explored in the projects:

- Creational Patterns: Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder Singleton.
- Structural Patterns: Composite
- Behavioral Patterns: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Memento, State, Strategy, Visitor.

Each subproject showcases a unique combination of two or more design patterns.

## How to Run

To explore a specific combination of patterns, navigate into the desired folder and follow the instructions in the respective README.md file.

## Thesis

For a detailed explanation of the research, you can access the full thesis on the University of the Peloponnese library [here](https://cs-msc.uop.gr/node/234).
